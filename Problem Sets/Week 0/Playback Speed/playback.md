# Playback Speed

---

Some people have a habit of ~~lecturing~~ speaking rather quickly, and it’d be nice to slow them down, a la YouTube’s 0.75 playback speed, or even by having them pause between words.

In a file called `playback.py`, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input, replacing each space with `...` (i.e., three periods).

## Hints

- Recall that input returns a str, per [docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input](docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input).
- Recall that a str comes with quite a few methods, per [docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods](docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods).
