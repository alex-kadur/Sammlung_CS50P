# Emojize

---

Because emoji aren‚Äôt quite as easy to type as text, at least on laptops and desktops, some programs support ‚Äúcodes,‚Äù whereby you can type, for instance, `:thumbs_up:`, which will be automatically converted to üëç. Some programs additionally support aliases, whereby you can more succinctly type, for instance, `:thumbsup:`, which will also be automatically converted to üëç.

See [carpedm20.github.io/emoji/all.html?enableList=enable_list_alias](carpedm20.github.io/emoji/all.html?enableList=enable_list_alias) for a list of codes with aliases.

In a file called `emojize.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for a `str` in English and then outputs the ‚Äúemojized‚Äù version of that `str`, converting any codes (or aliases) therein to their corresponding emoji.

## Hints

- Note that the `emoji` module comes with two functions, per [pypi.org/project/emoji](pypi.org/project/emoji), one of which is `emojize`, which takes an optional, named parameter called language. You can install it with:

```
pip install emoji
```
